# Advent of Code Dec 2023

[Advent of Code site](https://adventofcode.com/)

One folder per day/puzzle  01-25

each folder has 2 Python scripts, 1 for each part of that day's problem `part1.py` and `part2.py`

- the base folder has a script `results.bash`, run it from the base folder to see accumulated results
- you will need to store your AoC session cookie in `.token` (NB don't commit this token to a git repo)
- run `mkday.bash n` where `n` is the day number to create the folder for that day, download that days input and some other setup
- edit `n/part1.py` (and `n/part2.py` after you solve part 1 of the puzzle) to solve the days puzzle
